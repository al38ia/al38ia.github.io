            <h2 id="introducing space" class="title">Introducing Space</h2>
            <p>Outer space is the endless expanse that lies beyond the atmosphere of our planet. It begins where the sky fades into darkness and stretches outward without limit, holding countless stars, planets, and galaxies within its reach. In space there is no air and no sound, only silence and vast distances that seem beyond imagination. It is a place of extremes, where blazing light and deep shadows exist side by side, and where mysteries wait to be uncovered. For many centuries people have looked to the night sky with wonder, creating stories, asking questions, and searching for meaning in the stars. With time, science has allowed us to explore further, to send machines and people beyond Earth, and to discover that our universe is greater than we ever believed. Yet what we know is still only a small piece of the whole. Outer space is more than darkness. It is a frontier of discovery and possibility, a reminder that beyond the world we know lies something far larger, filled with secrets still waiting to be revealed.</p>
            <h2 id="Space genral information" class="title">General space Information</h2>
            <p>Space is the vast region beyond the Earth where the universe unfolds in all its immensity. It contains billions of galaxies, and each galaxy holds billions of stars along with planets, moons, and countless other objects. The distances across space are so great that they are measured in light years, the distance light travels in a single year, which is about nine trillion kilometers.In space there is no atmosphere like the one that surrounds our planet. Without air there can be no sound, and the temperatures can shift from extreme heat to extreme cold. Gravity is weaker the farther one travels from Earth, allowing astronauts to float freely inside their spacecraft. Although space may appear empty, it is filled with radiation, particles, and energy that move across its great expanses.Exploration of space has taught humanity much about our place in the universe. Telescopes allow us to look deep into the past by observing light that has traveled for millions of years, while missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond show that worlds other than our own can be reached. Yet, despite centuries of study, most of the universe remains unknown, leaving space as one of the greatest mysteries still waiting to be fully understood.</p>

            <h2 id="Space Facts" class="title">Space Facts</h2>
            <p>Space is filled with fascinating facts that reveal how extraordinary the universe truly is. The Sun, which gives life to Earth, is so large that more than one million Earths could fit inside it. Light from the Sun takes only eight minutes to reach us, even though the distance is about one hundred fifty million kilometers. The Moon, our closest neighbor in space, is over three hundred thousand kilometers away, yet it still affects the tides of our oceans every day. Beyond our solar system, there are countless stars and planets. Astronomers estimate that there are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches of Earth. Some stars are so massive that they burn for only a short time, while others are smaller and shine for billions of years. Black holes, formed from the collapse of giant stars, are so powerful that nothing, not even light, can escape their gravity. Space is also constantly moving and changing. Planets orbit stars, galaxies spin, and the universe itself is expanding. Even though scientists have learned many facts about space, most of it is still a mystery. Every discovery adds a new piece to the puzzle, reminding us that space is far larger and more complex than we can fully imagine.</p>
